# TOPRBF_SiPESC
This is a Python program developed for the 2D topology optimization design of mean compliance minimum problem.</br>
It is based on a parameterized level set method using radial basis functions, which is proposed in the following paper:</br>

Wei, P., Li, Z., Li, X., & Wang, M. Y. (2018). An 88-line MATLAB Code for the Parameterized Level Set Method Based Topology Optimization Using Radial Basis Functions. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 58(2), 831-849</br>

This script needs to be run in SiPESC, a CAE software developed by Dalian University of Technology. Website: http://sipesc.dlut.edu.cn


Install SiPESC, run this script, and select your cdb file exported by ANSYS, then you can finally obtain an optimized structural topology, such as follows:</br>
